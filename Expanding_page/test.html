           <p> A memory is just like a human brain.
            It is used to store data and instructions. 
            Computer memory is the storage space in the computer, 
            where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored.
            The memory is divided into large number of small parts called cells. 
            Each location or cell has a unique address, which varies from zero to memory size minus one.
            For example, if the computer has 64k words, then this memory unit has 64 * 1024 = 65536 memory locations.
            The address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535.</p>
            
           <p> Cache memory is a very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up the CPU.
            It acts as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory.
            It is used to hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used by the CPU.
            The parts of data and programs are transferred from the disk to cache memory by the operating system, 
            from where the CPU can access them.</p>

           <p> Primary memory holds only those data and instructions on which the computer is currently working.
            It has a limited capacity and data is lost when power is switched off.
            It is generally made up of semiconductor device. 
            These memories are not as fast as registers. 
            The data and instruction required to be processed resides in the main memory.
            It is divided into two subcategories RAM and ROM.</p>
